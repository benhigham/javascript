# JavaScript Tooling Configs

Monorepo of shareable JavaScript/TypeScript tooling configurations published to npm under the `@benhigham` scope.

## Language

**Consumer-facing dependency**:
A runtime `dependency` of a published config package that ships to and affects consumers — e.g. the bundled ESLint/Stylelint plugins, or `@commitlint/config-conventional`. A bump to one changes consumer behaviour and warrants a release. Pinned directly in each package's `package.json`.
_Avoid_: bundled dependency (use only when contrasting against peer/dev)

**Tooling dependency**:
A dependency used only to develop, lint, or build this repo, routed through the pnpm `catalog:` (e.g. `eslint`, `typescript`, `prettier`, `stylelint`, `turbo`). A bump has no consumer impact and warrants no release.
_Avoid_: dev dependency (overloaded with the literal `devDependencies` field)

**Release coverage**:
The invariant that every change to a published package's consumer-facing surface has a corresponding changeset, so its version bump and changelog are complete and nothing needs retroactive reconciliation. The surface is the _resolved behavior_ a consumer gets, not the set of files shipped — an internal restructure with byte-identical resolved behavior owes no changeset, even when the published tarball's file tree changes (or a previously-implied option becomes explicit without changing what TypeScript computes).
_Avoid_: changeset coverage

**Primitive config**:
A `@benhigham/tsconfig` variant defined by the two orthogonal axes — runtime environment (node vs browser/DOM) and emit mode (library vs app) — rather than by a target framework. The package ships only primitives (`node` (the `.` default), `browser`, `node-app`, `browser-app`); framework toolchains (Next, Astro, Vite) are served by composing a primitive with the framework's own config and docs, never a bespoke variant.
_Avoid_: framework config (the deliberately-rejected alternative — see ADR-0001)

**Config fragment**:
An internal, unexported building block of `@benhigham/tsconfig` carrying one axis's worth of `compilerOptions` — an _emit_ fragment (`emit-library`, `emit-app`) or an _environment_ fragment (`env-node`, `env-browser`). Each primitive is composed as `base` + one emit fragment + one environment fragment via an `extends` array; fragments live in `src/internal/` and are never exported.
_Avoid_: preset, partial config

**Library config**:
A primitive whose emit mode is _library_: `tsc` emits JavaScript + `.d.ts`. The `node` (default) and `browser` configs. For consumers publishing a package whose types others consume.
_Avoid_: build config

**App config**:
A primitive whose emit mode is _app_: `noEmit` — a bundler (Vite/esbuild/swc) or runtime type-stripper performs the transpile and `tsc` only type-checks. The `node-app` and `browser-app` configs. For consumers building an application, not publishing types.
_Avoid_: bundler config, noEmit config

**Browserslist floor**:
The lowest browser/runtime a consumer's code must not break, taken from `@benhigham/browserslist-config` (e.g. `chrome 126`). It is the line that governs how floor-sensitive lint rules — those steering code toward ECMAScript built-ins that `compat` cannot catch (e.g. `unicorn/no-array-sort`, whose `.toSorted()` fix needs Chrome 110+) — are tuned: relaxed when the floor sits below the feature, required when it sits at or above. (Regex-flag syntax is _not_ such a case: the `v` flag is gated on the consumer's tsconfig `target`, a compile-time axis this floor doesn't move — see ADR-0004.)
_Avoid_: baseline, browser target, browserslist target

**Resolved config**:
The rule set (with parser, globals, and settings) ESLint computes for a single file path after composing every layer of an exported `@benhigham/eslint-config` config. It is what a consumer's file actually gets — the genuine interface of the package, and the surface its tests assert against — as opposed to the exported config arrays, which are the ingredients that compose into it.
_Avoid_: the config (overloaded — say "config arrays" or "config source" for the ingredients), effective config

**Composition invariant**:
A guarantee about which rule configuration wins for a given file, arising from the order and scoping of the layers an `@benhigham/eslint-config` export composes rather than from any single layer — e.g. the JS-vs-TS split that keeps the type-checked global disables off `.js`, the re-applied "last-wins" curated tail, per-environment `n`/`compat` scoping on browser source vs Node files, and prettier applied last. The class of decisions the package's tests assert against the resolved config, currently load-bearing on code comments alone.
_Avoid_: composition decision, tuning (too vague)

**Type-test file**:
A vitest test file using the `-d` suffix convention — `*.{test,spec}-d.{ts,tsx,mts,cts}` — whose body holds type-level assertions (`expectTypeOf`/`assertType`) rather than runtime ones. Inherently TypeScript and meaningful only with type information, so `@benhigham/eslint-config` lints it solely in the type-aware layer (where `typecheck: true` rides with `projectService`), never under the base/non-type-aware exports; the runtime test layer excludes it outright. The few curated vitest rules that assume a runtime test (`require-hook`, `padding-around-expect-groups`) are turned off for it.
_Avoid_: type test (the activity), test file (overloaded — reserve for runtime `*.{test,spec}.*` files)
